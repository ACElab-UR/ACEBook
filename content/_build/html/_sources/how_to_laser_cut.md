# Laser Cutting Guidelines

**Laser**: VLS2.30 | **Contact Person**: Florian Weinzierl (Florian2.Weinzierl@chemie.uni-regensburg.de)

## UPON ARRIVAL
Do not forget to book a laser cutting slot online using the GroupWise calendar. Tell someone that you are going to be using the laser cutter.
- Sign the user book and specify what materials will be cut (red book right of the computer)
- Turn computer ON (bottom right of the screen - underneath)
- Switch ON the USB hub (the laser won't work if it is OFF)
- Once computer is ON switch the laser ON by pressing its “POWER” button
## USING CORELDRAW
Do not connect the laser computer to the internet and do not update the CorelDraw version on it. You can either open a CorelDraw file or import an SVG file.
If importing an SVG file:
- Unlock the shape – Press the shape > Ungroup > Press the shape > Unlock > Press the shape > Ungroup
- Make all cutting lines red and make their thickness “hairline” – Right-most vertical tab > Object properties > Press the shape > Line thickness (top dropdown menu) = “hairline”
- Make all engraving lines black.
- If multiple laser passes are required, for example to cut 3 pieces of paper in one go, simply copy and paste the shapes on top of each other that many times. The laser will recognize multiple cut layers but not multiple engraving layers.
## CUTTING
Do not stare directly at the laser and avoid leaving it unattended for long periods of time. If unsure of anything, please reach out for help before doing it.
If repeating a print:
- Open VLS2.30 > Use the history tab on the upper-left corner to reopen a previous file.
- Open the laser lid and align the laser and the material by using “Focus View” (button next to the magnifying glass) and pressing different areas of the cutting area checking where they fall in the material.
- Close the laser lid and turn the fan ON (LVL 3 for paper and LVL 5 for wood and acrylic – to do this press both arrows until the green light starts blinking and then adjust the level).
- Press the PLAY button to initiate cutting.
If launching a new print:
- Once the CorelDraw file is ready select the shapes of interest
- Press print > Ensure that “Current Selection” is selected > Go to the layout tab (this fixes a bug which rescales the print automatically) > Back to overview > Preferences > Load the laser settings needed (can use a preset in the ACElab folder) > Press OK > Press Print > Move to VLS2.30
- Open the laser lid and align the laser and the material by using “Focus View” (button next to the magnifying glass) and pressing different areas of the cutting area checking where they fall in the material.
- Close the laser lid and turn the fan ON (LVL 3 for paper and LVL 5 for wood and acrylic – to do this press both arrows until the green light starts blinking and then adjust the level).
- Press the PLAY button to initiate cutting.
## CHANGING LASER SETTINGS
It is always best to try these on a small portion of the material before cutting the desired shape.

Laser settings include:
>	**Power**  

>	**Speed**  

>	**PPI (pulses per inch)** – higher is slower but better resolution  

>    **Z-axis correction** defines how thick the material is  

>    Different **colors** for engraving and cutting can be used – if the shape selection contains multiple colors do not forget to skip the ones that are not meant to be used
## CHANGING & CLEANING BEDS
There are two beds - normal cutting bed & engraving bed (which has rulers around its edges). The cutting bed is used for wood and acrylic, does not require thorough cleaning and usually stays inside the laser. The engraving bed is used for paper or if a more precise alignment is required, it is usually kept in a cupboard underneath to the right of the computer and requires cleaning after use.
To change the bed:
- Move the bed all the way down using the laser arrow buttons
- Unscrew the bed and remove it being careful not to hit the laser
- The cutting bed (for wood and acrylic) does not get screwed in, however ensure that it sits firmly and the connectors at its base are plugged in
- After removing a bed, the laser height needs to be reset. To do this, go to VLS2.30 to Focus View > Go > Adjust Z height = -0.5mm
To clean the engraving bed: 
- Ensure both sides of the bed are clean
- Start with Scheuermilch (yellow detergent bottle)
- Water
- Acetone
- Place back in cupboard (underneath to the right of the computer)
## BEFORE LEAVING
Leave the place as you found it or better! Clean after yourself and do not leave material behind unless previously agreed upon.
- Switch the laser OFF by pressing its “POWER” button
- Ensure the laser fan is OFF
- Turn computer OFF
- Switch OFF the USB hub
- Ensure the beds, cleaning products and materials are all in their respective places
- Turn OFF the lights
