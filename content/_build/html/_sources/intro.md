Welcome to The Animal Comparative Economics Book!
===================================================

```{epigraph}
Animals must constantly make economic decisions to survive. Understanding the preference for one option over another is key to decision making. We are building on insights from the study of behavioural economics and cognitive psychology in order to understand how animals evaluate options, and thus make decisions, both alone and collectively.
Our research focuses mostly on invertebrates, especially ants, as they offer a fast and flexible platform for testing decision making.
